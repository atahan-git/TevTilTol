XT Reorder v2.2
-----------------

Ever wanted to reorder the components in the Inspector using drag and drop? Well, now you can.

XT Reorder is a ridiculously useful utility for Unity 5 that enables the reordering of components right in the Inspector. No new windows, no cumbersome user interfaces, just drag and drop.


How to use
------------

1) Select a GameObject or Prefab,
2) Hold down the ALT key to enable the reordering support,
3) Drag any component in the Inspector to a new position,
4) Drop the component.

Please notice you can change the reordering activation mode (there are 3 different modes) and other settings in the XT Reorder preferences page.


Keyboard Shortcuts
--------------------

- Alt + R : Toggle Reordering On / Off.
- Alt + C : Collapse (Fold) All components in the Inspector.
- Alt + E : Expand (Unfold) All components in the Inspector.
- Ctrl + Alt + Up / Down : Rotate all components Up or Down in the Inspector (Windows).
- Cmd + Alt + Up / Down : Rotate all components Up or Down in the Inspector (Mac).


Installation
--------------

Once purchased in the Unity Asset Store and downloaded the XT Reorder package should be already installed on your system and ready to use in your projects. You just need to import the package in one of these two ways:

1) If you are creating a new project, click the "Asset packages..." button in the New Project window and mark the "XT Reorder" checkbox to get the package automatically imported.

2) If you want to import XT Reorder into an existing project, just login to the Asset Store (Window > Asset Store), toggle the Download Manager (inbox icon on the upper left corner), find the package and click on the Import button to get the package automatically imported into your current project.


Technical Info
---------------

* Yes, UNDO is supported ;)
* Reordering is automatically disabled when the Editor enters in Play mode.
* Reordering in prefab instances causes Unity to ask you if wish to break the connection with the prefab. Not my fault, that's how Unity works.


Known Issues
--------------

* The shortcuts Alt + R, Alt + C, Alt + E won't work while a property text field is edited in the Inspector.
* Prior to Unity 5.4, the Alt key won't enable the reordering support if the Asset Store or the Services window are open (even if they're not visible). Not my fault.
* Reordering of components in multiple selection is not currently supported.
